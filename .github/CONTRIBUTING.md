## Troubleshooting

## Windows and macOS

- Podman on Windows and macOS must be run in "rootful" mode with `podman machine set --rootful`.

### Windows with Git BASH

- Git BASH users should set `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` in their "~/.bashrc" file (create it if it does not exist)
- Git BASH users can avoid the warning "please create a known_hosts file. The next time this host is connected to, podman will add it to known_hosts", with `touch ~/.ssh/known_hosts`
